## üìù Description
**ValueVerse** is a simple web application designed to simplify stock valuation using three well-known financial models: **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**, **Dividend Discount Model (DDM)**, and a **Warren Buffett-inspired formula**. This tool allows users to input company-specific data and receive calculated stock values based on their chosen model. 

This project was primarily developed to deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and have a little fun trying to build a functional and visually appealing web interface, rather than providing sophisticated financial valuation models.
